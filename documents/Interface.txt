Vinh:
To build the HTML files the entry in the comparison table is split to get the filenames of both files.

From the highlight comparison lines tracy output is standard list [ [1, 5], [9, 10]] while Trevor is something like 
{0: [0, [1, 5]], 1: [5, [9, 15]]} to get the coloring information to match on both sides. For both of them the line number
should start at 1. Probably need some way to standarize the output to get what lines to highlight and what color it should 
be to match on both sides. I have an array with 9-10 colors to cycle through to highlight the lines.
