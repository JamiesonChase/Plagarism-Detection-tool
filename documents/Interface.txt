Vinh:
To build the HTML files the entry in the comparison table is split to get the filenames of both files.

From the highlight comparison lines tracy output is standard list [ [1, 5], [9, 10]] while Trevor is something like 
{0: [0, [1, 5]], 1: [5, [9, 15]]} to get the coloring information to match on both sides. For both of them the line number
should start at 1. Probably need some way to standarize the output to get what lines to highlight and what color it should 
be to match on both sides. I have an array with 9-10 colors to cycle through to highlight the lines. 


Possible output for the highlight comparison lines:
[ [colorInfromationCorresponding to otherFile, [start line number, end line number]],  [colorInfromation, [start line number, end line number]]]
1 of these for each file.
If the block on one file doesn't have a correspondence to the other file that will 
show up on the table at the top leave an empty array [] at the location.
If it makes it easier the line start and end blocks does not have to be in continous, I can 
try to modify my code to deal with it.
Example:
File1Highlight = [ [0, [3, 6]], [], [1, [9, 8]]]
File2Highlight = [ [1, [9, 8]], [0, [5, 7]], [0, [1, 3]]]

For the corpus I need a way to add two different direcotries to it and 
then go through the comparison for the input directory and have everything
still work.
