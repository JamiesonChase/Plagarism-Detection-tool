The first thing that happens is that the directory is path is loaded. It checks for 
.py or .c files and add it to a dictionary and returns that.

Next the corpus will be built. For each path in the previous dictionary, the first thing 
that happens is the path is processed. In this step the file is opened and it's content 
is sent through the pygments lexer function to get it's tokens. For each token, it adds to 
the process list a replacement if it's a name, string, function or comment, or keep the same 
thing, and append to the token if the regular token unless it's a comment than it replaces it 
with a new line. All the tokens in the process list and the stripped list is joined together and the 
stripped list is written out to a file while the processed part is returned.

The next step to creating the corpus is to pass it to the hashing function. The hashing function will 
go through each substring of a certain size and turn it to a numeric value and keep track of the index 
of each hash. It returns the the index of each hash and the hash as a list of tuples.

The next step to creating the corpus is do the winnowing algorithm on the hashes.
This function returns a subset of the hashes.
